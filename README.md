# Trivia Extraordinaire

My breakable toy, "Trivia Extraordinaire", is a trivia app composed of over 200,000 questions,
found by crawling the Jeopardy archives. The user can chose between multiple question categories
and multiple levels of difficulty, where the time to complete each question is decreased as the level
increases. The user can view their comprehensive history, including their favorite category, total
number of points accumulated and the badges they've collected through the feats they've accomplished.
The user can also chose to add their own trivia questions. These are just some of the numerous features
in "Trivia Extraordinaire".

## Development
* The trivia data was filtered using a combination of Ruby, Perl, and Regular Expressions
