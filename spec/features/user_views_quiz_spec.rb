# As a user that wants to play some trivia
# I should be able to play a quiz of my choosing
# So that I can have fun
#
# [] I should see the quiz's category
# [] I should see the total number of questions
# [] I should see if the quiz was created by a user or not
# [] Each question should flow to the next using React
# [] If I get a question right I should see a "correct" message
# [] If I get a question wrong I should see an "incorrect" message
# [] I should be able to see four different potential answers for each question
# [] The three incorrect answers should be taken from questions from the same category
# [] Once I complete the quiz I should see my score
# [] Once I complete the quiz I should have the option to replay that same category or go back to the root path
# [] I should see how much time I have left to complete each question
