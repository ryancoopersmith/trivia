# As a user that wants to play some trivia
# I should be able to see a list of the different categories
# So that I can get trivia questions that I am interested in
#
# [] The categories should show up randomized when the page loads
# [] There should be a search bar that searches for a particular category
# [] The categories should be paginated and each page should load asynchronously using React
# [] When I click on a category I should be taken to that category's quiz
# [] User created questions should appear separately from the Jeopardy questions
